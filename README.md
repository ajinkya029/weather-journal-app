# Weather Journal App

## Project Overview

The Weather Journal App is an asynchronous web application that dynamically updates the user interface with weather data and user input. It integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather information based on the user's input of a ZIP code. Users can enter their feelings along with the ZIP code, and the app displays the temperature, date, and user response on the screen.

2. Enter their feelings: Users can enter their feelings or thoughts for the day.
3. Generate Weather Details: By clicking the "Generate" button, the app retrieves the weather data, stores it along with the user's feelings, and dynamically updates the UI to display the temperature, date, and user response.

## Code Structure

The code for the Weather Journal App is structured as follows:

- `server.js`: This file contains the server code using Express.js. It handles the GET and POST routes for retrieving and storing weather data.
- `website` directory: This directory contains the client-side code for the app.
- `index.html`: The HTML file that defines the structure and layout of the app.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the app's appearance.
- `app.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the client-side logic, including fetching weather data, updating the UI, and handling user interactions.

## API Documentation

The Weather Journal App integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data. To use the app, you need to obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap. Visit the OpenWeatherMap website and sign up for an account to obtain your API key. Once you have the API key, update the `apiKey` variable in the `app.js` file with your own key.
